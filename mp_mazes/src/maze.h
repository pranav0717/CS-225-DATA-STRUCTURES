     * For each square on the bottom row (maximum y coordinate), there is a
     * distance from the origin (i.e. the top-left cell), which is defined as
     * the length (measured as a number of steps) of the only path through

     * origin as the destination of the maze. solveMaze() returns the
     * winning path from the origin to the destination as a vector of
     * integers, where each integer represents the direction of a step, using
     * the same encoding as in canTravel().
     *
     * If multiple paths of maximum length exist, use the one with the
     * destination cell that has the smallest x value.

     * in the maze.
